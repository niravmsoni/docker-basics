sInstalled Docker Desktop here - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
We have provision to run images on both Windows/Linux OS through Docker Desktop.

Selected "Switch to Windows Container" to make sure all containers run on Windows OS.

Command 
    - docker version
        - Gives us the details about docker client and docker server running on the machine

Containers can be run in multiple ways:
    1. Task container to do one thing and exit
        - This type of containers just do one thing and then are destroyed
