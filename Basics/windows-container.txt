Installed Docker Desktop here - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
We have provision to run images on both Windows/Linux OS through Docker Desktop.

Selected "Switch to Windows Container" to make sure all containers run on Windows OS.

Command 
    - docker version
        - Gives us the details about docker client and docker server(Windows service) running on the machine

Containers can be run in different ways:
    1. Single Task container
        - This type of containers just perform a task and then it'll end
        - Useful for automation(Azure CLI commands > One time execution etc. )
    
    Command:
        - docker container run docker4dotnet/nanoserver hostname
        - Downloads 
    2. Long Running container
        - Long running applications
        - If we download an image from dockerhub, we could use interactive session with powershell to explore the image, its Windows features, services etc.
        - docker container run --interactive --tty --rm docker4dotnet/servercore powershell
            - Spin up powershell from docker4dotnet/servercore from container
            - --interactive --tty - Gives me an interactive session
            - --rm - When we stop/remove container, remove the interactive session as well for me. This will also delete the image for me
            - exit - When done, this will leave session from container and bring us back to our machine

By Default - Upon stopping a container, the image still PERSISTS ON THE LOCAL MACHINE. Docker does not remove the image
If we specify --rm switch, image also will be deleted.
