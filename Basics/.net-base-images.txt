The base image is the image you use in the FROM line in your Dockerfile. It was built with a Dockerfile and it comes packaged with software:

nginx is a Linux image with the web server installed
nanoserver is a Windows image with just the OS installed
aspnet is a Windows image with IIS and ASP.NET installed
Microsoft maintain Docker images for the .NET stack on their own registry, mcr.microsoft.com.

.NET Core image

Pulling runtime images
    - Just has .NET Core installed.
    - We can use that to run an application that is pre-compiled
    - Doesn't have SDK so we can't compile the application
    - Doesn't have ASP.NET Runtime, so we can't run application
    - This will be useful if we want to run Console applications/Background apps/Batch processing etc. that are pre-compiled

TaskContainer
docker run mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.1 dotnet --list-runtimes
-- This command uses .NET CLI to list all runtimes installed

Pulling SDK image
    - SDK image has all the MSBuild tools
    - Using that we can compile our code

If we do not have an image locally and if we execute run command for it, it will download that image first and then execute it.

docker run mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1 dotnet --list-sdks
    -Downloads SDK 3.1 image and then using .NET CLI to run commands

Pulling ASP.NET Core image
    - Builds on runtime image and adds web server runtime.
    - IMP - Recommendation - We should ideally use smallest image to give us what we need.
        - For Console app -> It should be based on runtime image
        - For WebAPI -> It should be based on aspnet image

Comparing all the images
    docker image ls mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/*:3.1

    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime = Smallest. Around 190MB - Used for Console applications. Based on Linux Debian.
    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet = Adds Web runtime to above image. So, its just 18 MBs more. Used for web based applications
    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk = Biggest. It is full blown SDK. NuGet dependencies, build dependencies and running them.

Windows images
