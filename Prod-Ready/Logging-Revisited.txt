Intro:

This is defined specially for Windows containers.
For Windows containers, logs are not relayed out from the container.
Earlier, we've seen a powershell script that relays logs into output stream. But that has a lot of constraints.
    1. It reads from a single file. So, we need to ensure app writes all its logs to the same file
    2. The other constraint is that if the file does not exist or does not create, container will fall over despite the fact that application is functioning well. Which is horrible.

So, we need to come up with a robust approach.
Now we'll revisit logging for containers where the application process runs in the background. We'll use the LogMonitor(https://github.com/microsoft/windows-container-tools/tree/main/LogMonitor) tool from Microsoft, which is built for containers and can relay logs from multiple sources to the standard output stream.
And we'll couple that with the ServiceMonitor(https://github.com/microsoft/IIS.ServiceMonitor) tool, which Microsoft also provide for containerized applications. It monitors a background Windows Service and bubbles up failures, so if the Windows Service exits then the container exits.


LogMonitor
Supported log sources include:
    Event Logs
    ETW Providers
    Custom App logs

Supported output locations include:
    STDOUT
Log Monitor is configured via the Log Monitor Config json file. The default location for the config file is: C:/LogMonitor/LogMonitorConfig.json or location passed to the LogMonitor.exe via /CONFIG switch.
The log tool is supported for Windows, Server Core, and Nano images.

ServiceMonitor - Monitors background service(w3wp) on which our application is running. In case if it fails, the service monitor will also exit. And we will know that there are some sort of issues with our application.

DockerFile with Logging added SQL Server
=====================
# LogMonitor - https://github.com/microsoft/windows-container-tools/tree/master/LogMonitor
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809 AS logmonitor
ARG LOGMONITOR_VERSION="v1.1"
ADD https://github.com/microsoft/windows-container-tools/releases/download/${LOGMONITOR_VERSION}/LogMonitor.exe .

# ServiceMonitor - https://github.com/microsoft/IIS.ServiceMonitor
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809 AS servicemonitor
ARG SERVICEMONITOR_VERSION="2.0.1.10"
ADD https://dotnetbinaries.blob.core.windows.net/servicemonitor/${SERVICEMONITOR_VERSION}/ServiceMonitor.exe .

# sql server
FROM docker4dotnet/sql-server:2017

ENV SA_PASSWORD="docker4.net!"

COPY --from=logmonitor /LogMonitor.exe /LogMonitor.exe
COPY --from=servicemonitor /ServiceMonitor.exe /ServiceMonitor.exe

COPY docker/04-02-logging-revisited/signup-db/start.ps1 /
COPY docker/04-02-logging-revisited/signup-db/LogMonitorConfig.json /LogMonitor/
=====================
Explanation: 
Multi-stage build. With first 2 steps, we're downloading LogMonitor and ServiceMonitor .exe's.
It does a few new things:

    Downloads the LogMonitor and ServiceMonitor tools
    Overrides the default SA password from the base image
    Replaces the startup script from the base image

New Commands:
ARG : We can replace ENV with ARG in our DockerFiles. Using that, we could easily make our DockerFiles future-proof. For ex: Today, we're using version "v1.1" but tomorrow let's say we want to use "v1.2", we could easily pass that version number as a new argument
That way we do not have to modify dockerFile everytime.

ADD : Equivalent to COPY. COPY works with local file-system whereas ADD works with files over the internet as well. This makes sure we do not need CURL or Invoke-WebRequest present within the DockerFile

Relaying Event Log entries
LogMonitor uses a JSON configuration file to specify the log sources.
LogMonitorConfig.json sets it to read the application Event Log which is where SQL Server write entries.
The start.ps1 ends by running ServiceMonitor to monitor the SQL Server Windows Service, and LogMonitor to relay the log entries.
LogMonitor wraps an executing process, so Docker sees the logs relayed by LogMonitor, but if the inner process exits then so does the container.

LogMonitorConfig.json
====================
{
    "LogConfig": {
      "sources": [
        {
          "type": "EventLog",
          "startAtOldestRecord": false,
          "eventFormatMultiLine": false,
          "channels": [
            {
              "name": "application",
              "level": "Information"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
====================
Explanation:
    Source = Event Log and supposed to relay information level logs.

}
else {
    Write-Verbose 'FATAL: SA password not supplied in sa_password or sa_password_path'
    return 1
}

Write-Verbose "Running LogMonitor and ServiceMonitor"
C:\LogMonitor.exe C:\ServiceMonitor.exe MSSQL`$SQLEXPRESS
=========
Explanation:
    Setting up SA Login password that was set in previous step.
    LogMonitor acts as a wrapper around ServiceMonitor and SQL Server.
    Service Monitor acts as a wrapper around SQL Server. 

    Log Monitor > Watches > Service Monitor > Watches > SQL Server
    If SQL Server stops, service monitor will know and it will stop. When service monitor stops, log monitor will also stop and so will the container.

Building new SQL Server image
There are multiple Docker Compose files for this section, breaking the app into different sets of components.

web.yml defines just the core application components, without the reverse proxy or the analytics features.

=======================
DB updated with Log Monitor and Service Monitor

Logging for .NET FRAMEWORK applications
Same pattern of combining LogMonitor and ServiceMonitor
LogMonitorConfig.json is set up to relay logs from the log file
the Dockerfile adds new stages to download the utilities and sets them as the entrypoint

LogMonitorConfig.json 
====================
{
    "LogConfig": {
      "sources": [
        {
          "type": "File",
          "directory": "C:\\logs",
          "filter": "SignUp.log",
          "includeSubdirectories": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
====================
Explanation: Source is C:\\logs and type is file.

===========
Explanation:
Same content as SQL Server. Will be used from Cache used by SQL Server
Updated entrypoint to be C:\LogMonitor.exe C:\ServiceMonitor.exe w3svc

Since, we've removed reverse proxy, all the Port mapping needs to be there in the docker compose.

App working fine.

Checking logs now:
We're able to see all logs correctly.

If we check the processes for SQL Server container and .NET Framework container,
we do see w3wp.exe -> Main worker process, 
We do see ServiceMonitor.exe -> Service Monitor process(With very little RAM And CPU)
We do see LogMonitor.exe -> Log Monitor process(With very little RAM And CPU)

For Reference-data-api(.NET Core API),
Logs directly are present in the standard output stream.
We do not need any extra resiliency here since, .NET Core DOES NOT RUN AS A BACKGROUND SERVICE.
If we check the Processes for .NET Core Container(Uses NanoServer container)
We see dotnet.exe -> Which is the main application running in the foreground. This will cause container to exit if application crashes

Now, for testing whether container exits when the main w3wp process is killed, we'd execute this commands:
=========
docker ps

docker exec 04_signup-web_1 powershell "Stop-Service w3svc"

docker ps
docker ps -a - Here, we would see state changed to exited.
=========

So, now we can start the container again and bring the app online

Operational consistency
Now our .NET apps all behave in the same way, where logs are available from the container and an application failure causes a container exit.
The next step is to make sure when the containers are running that the app really is working correctly.
