Packaging .NET Framework apps directly from sourcecode

Multi-staged Docker file
    - 1 Docker File which produces 1 docker image
    - There are multiple stages to it.

DockerFile
-------------------------------
# escape=`
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/sdk:4.8 AS builder

WORKDIR C:\src
COPY src .
RUN .\build-web.bat

# app image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:4.8
SHELL ["powershell", "-Command", "$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop';"]

WORKDIR C:\web-app
RUN New-WebApplication -Name 'app' -Site 'Default Web Site' -PhysicalPath C:\web-app

COPY --from=builder C:\out\_PublishedWebsites\SignUp.Web .
-------------------------------

build-web.bat
----------------------

nuget restore SignUp.Web.sln

msbuild SignUp.Web\SignUp.Web.csproj /p:OutputPath=c:\out /p:Configuration=Release

----------------------

Explanation - DockerFile:
There are 2 FROM Statements
    - FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/sdk:4.8 AS builder
        - This is downloading Microsoft's SDK to compile the application

    - FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:4.8
        - This is using Microsoft's ASP.NET Framework 4.8 image to run application

There are 2 stages:
    1. Builder stage
        - Here, we download Microsoft's SDK
        - We're using build-web.bat batch file to NuGet restore and build application
        - IMP - "AS builder" = name of stage. We can refer to this stage anytime later in DockerFile.
        
    2. Application image
        - Using ASP.NET Framework 4.8 image
            - Doesn't have any SDK tools.
        - Using powershell as shelling tool.
        - Setting up Work Directory as C:\web-app
        - Using "RUN New-WebApplication" - We're setting up our web application into IIS

IMP - With Multi-stage DockerFiles, whatever we have in the FINAL FROM is going to build up the final application.
So, to check this with current demo, if we try to find msbuild version in the container, we will see an error since MSBuild is used as a part of first stage and it won't be present inside the container.

So, its important to copy all the things you need in your final stage of application.
Nothing will be copied explicitly.

Checking what's in the final image
The application image has all the content but none of the SDK tools.

Content from earlier stages only makes it to the final image when it's explicitly copied in.

Confirm the DLLs are there but not the build tools:

Command to see what's present in the container
-----------
docker container run --rm --entrypoint powershell signup-web:02-02 ls /web-app/bin/SignUp*
-----------

Command to confirm MSBuild is not present in the final container.
-----------
docker container run --rm --entrypoint powershell signup-web:02-02 msbuild -version
-----------

IMP - This is much better than the MSI
Everything is done in Docker, you don't need any build tools on the machine (not even .NET) and everyone will use the same versions of the tools.

Right now, the build is actually happening inside a batch file but docker doesn't know what's inside the batch file.
Hence it won't be able to use the cache

So, if we modify a minor value in the web.config, and retry building the image, 
The first step we see is it tries to go and use Cache.

PRACTICALLY - If we modify even 1 line of code in source code, entire Cache will be invalidated.
And we would be changing the SourceCode frequently as compared to the Dependencies our project has.
So, to make this work, we need to have an improved version

Improved Version of DockerFile
-------------------------------
# escape=`
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/sdk:4.8 AS builder

WORKDIR C:\src
COPY src\SignUp.Web.sln .
COPY src\SignUp.Core\SignUp.Core.csproj .\SignUp.Core\
COPY src\SignUp.Entities\SignUp.Entities.csproj .\SignUp.Entities\
COPY src\SignUp.Messaging\SignUp.Messaging.csproj .\SignUp.Messaging\
COPY src\SignUp.Model\SignUp.Model.csproj .\SignUp.Model\
COPY src\SignUp.Web\SignUp.Web.csproj .\SignUp.Web\
COPY src\SignUp.Model\packages.config .\SignUp.Model\
COPY src\SignUp.Web\packages.config .\SignUp.Web\
RUN nuget restore SignUp.Web.sln

COPY src C:\src
RUN msbuild SignUp.Web\SignUp.Web.csproj /p:OutputPath=c:\out /p:Configuration=Release

# app image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:4.8
SHELL ["powershell", "-Command", "$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop';"]

ENV APP_ROOT=C:\web-app

WORKDIR ${APP_ROOT}
RUN New-WebApplication -Name 'app' -Site 'Default Web Site' -PhysicalPath $env:APP_ROOT

COPY --from=builder C:\out\_PublishedWebsites\SignUp.Web ${APP_ROOT}
-------------------------------

Explanation:
Again a multi-staged build but here, we're copying individual CSProj's and putting them inside src directory.
At the end, we're running a nuget restore.

BENEFIT - In-case if there are no changes in Core project or Entity project, it'll be picked from the Cache.
Build will be faster.

DockerFile = Infrastructure as Code.
Instead of referring to same code in multiple places, its better to store the path in an environment variable and referring that environment variable wherever we need.
